# Game
 
My task is to create a game based on the logic we have learnt over the last four weeks.

I will be be creating a story based adventure with button presses, inputs and different endings. 

My main challenge will be scipting the story branches, and ensuring that the impact of previous choices take place. 

After stcripting the story branches the step to condense the code was taken whereby I could remove all other steps in the story aside from the ending. 

My next step was to add music, though I currently have a bug that is not allowing the button to work on click.

In future I want to add more story paths, more endings, tidy up the code, and allow for story beats to follow on.
